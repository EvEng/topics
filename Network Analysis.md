## Background Information
None of the members on the team are super familiar with the details of network analysis. However, we have found a pretty in-depth resource [here](https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis). There seems to be a heavy focus on social networks.

## Roadmap
This section will be updated as Dr. Mockus recommends papers that he would like to see covered or as we choose a set of papers to discuss.
