## Description
We wanted to focus on the parallelization techniques for big data analysis, such as mapreduce or perhaps parallel DBMS.

## Presentations
- Application of FDA High-Performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) Supercomputer to Analysis of Cardiac Safety Clinical Trials
- Dustin McAfee
- 15-20 minutes
- Will be presenting with slides from a previous presentation,
    which covers a porting of an existing Electrocardiogram Analysis Software to a
    highly parallelized environment, the HIVE Supercomputer. The powerpoint slides were
    not altered, because this presentation was approved to be shown out of circuit along with
    the poster that was presented with it at the Office of Clinical Pharmacology (FDA/OCP) Day on December 5th, 2016.
- This presentation is available from a collaboration between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (FDA/CDER), the Division of Applied Regulatory Science (FDA/CDER/DARS), and 
    the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (FDA/CBER). The open source project is available at https://github.com/FDA/ecglib.
- Will be ready 1/22.
